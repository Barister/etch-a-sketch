# Etch-A-Sketch Project

---

The Odin Project Foundation Course homework.

A browser version of something between a sketchpad and Etch-A-Sketch in my implementation.

Just the second project for me to try some CSS and DOM Manipulation skills from scratch.

Finally the code uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create and manage a visual grid 
where you can draw in different modes. 

Some features of the code include creating the grid, resizing it, drawing and erasing with a mouse, 
and drawing with a wheel under the screen.

I'm sure there are many repetitions, errors, and other problems typical of a beginner in the code, 
but I'm already tired of this project. 

The functionality of controlling the drawing process using Etch-a-Sketch wheels 
that are operated by keyboard buttons or mouse has been particularly challenging for me.

I'm also having problems adapting it for mobile devices, 
so the "application" is more suitable for computers than mobile devices.
